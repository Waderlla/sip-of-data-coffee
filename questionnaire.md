# Survey: Your Coffee Habits and Preferences

Thank you for taking part in my survey!  
I want to better understand your habits, preferences, and attitude toward coffee to create an engaging data storytelling project and an attractive dashboard, which I’ll present as infographics on LinkedIn and GitHub.

The survey is anonymous and aimed at a broad audience – including both coffee drinkers and those who don’t drink coffee.

The survey will take about 5–7 minutes to complete.  
Your responses will help me create insightful charts and visual summaries about the world of coffee lovers – and those who prefer other drinks.

Let’s get started!
